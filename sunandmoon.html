			Dear Clare, <br>

				I trust this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I've delved into the matter you spoke of,
				and what I've uncovered is nothing short of astonishing.

				The initial report of illness surfaced approximately a month following the moon landing. It all started
				in Virginia, and after that, nothing was heard of the astronauts. For nearly two more months, there was
				a strange quietness, until Virginia authorities imposed a lockdown. The hospitals quickly filled up, and
				hundreds of lives were lost. You likely know the grim details that followed. Enclosed within this
				letter, you'll find the evidence I've gathered from various hospitals in the region.

				It's become increasingly clear that the situation is dire, Clare. Many folks are fleeing the area, and
				it seems that even Texas, once considered a haven, is no longer safe. I've heard rumors that the wealthy
				are resorting to unconventional means of escape. Have you heard of the numerous spaceship accidents
				lately? Far too many to ignore. I'm admittedly frightened, but I'll attempt the journey nonetheless. I
				don't have many options left. I'll be departing California in a mere two days, so as you read this, I
				may already be soaring through the skies.

				I regret not having the chance to bid you farewell in person. My mother fell terribly ill, necessitating
				my swift return home. Sadly, her condition remains unchanged. In fact, she seems unresponsive, much like
				everyone else who succumbed to this ailment. She simply ceased to exist: no breath, no pulse, not even
				a hint of blood. Yet, she remains with us, devoid of decay. I had hoped she possessed a certain
				strength, but it appears she couldn't overcome this ordeal. I've made the difficult decision to leave
				her behind. I apologize for this, Clare.

				Should you ever come across the antidote we seek, please consider paying her a visit. She's at home with
				her beloved cats, or at least they were there the last time I saw them.

				Farewell for now, Clare, and may the winds of fortune guide us to safer shores.

				<br> Yours in tumultuous times, Pat    </p>
